# React Native Brownfield Navigation Demo

This repository hosts sample code on how to integrate React Native with an existing iOS app's UINavigationController stack.

## How to run

- Clone this project
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start-ios`

## About

This sample code is based in part on work done by Wix's [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation).

This is a not a framework! This is a custom solution for existing iOS apps that use Objective-C and/or Swift. This code may be helpful to you if you are looking to integrate React Native into your app.
